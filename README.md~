# Python Recipe Scraper

This is my first web scraping project. The goal is to scrape random recipes within given categories on allrecipes.com and email them to me at the start of each week.

## Ideas for Future

I would like to eventually add the following features:
* Create shopping lists based on ingredients in recipes
* Run on local server scheduled with cron

More to come...
